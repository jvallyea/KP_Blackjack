Below are instructions regarding how to run and play
the blackjack.py file.

Instructions to Run:

In a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the
blackjack.py file. The code was written in Python 2
and incorporates the random library from Python. This
should be a built-in library, so there's no need to
pip install any extra libraries.

To run the file once in the folder, type
" python blackjack.py" into the terminal.


Instructions to Play:

When run, you will be prompted for your first deal.
Either type "deal" or "exit" into the terminal
(without the quotations). Following the print screen
for your hand and the dealers hand, you will have
the option to either "hit" or "stay". Simply type
in your choice.

If you're interested in counting cards, the initial
deck contains 4 standard 52-card decks put together.
Each round lasts for 10 deals, after which a new
deck is put into place.
